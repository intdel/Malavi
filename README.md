# Malavi
Malavi is a hybrid desktop/web email application. It gives you the best of both worlds. This means that you can use all great features that the web mail client provides, but you also get advantages that a local application can provide. These advantages include: Independence of the browser process, notifications, increased productivity due to separate app.

#Notes
 - The browser part of this project relies on JXBrowser by TeamDev. In 
order to be able to compile, you will need to download their libraries. 
(It will be included later on, but for now I am using the evaluation 
license).
 - So far only tested on Windows 10 with Java 1.8_66
 - If you want to run it on Linux/OS X you WILL need Java 1.8_66. I was able to run it on Linux mint, but I noticed that there were some (small) UI issues.
 - Since this is the first major release, it might still have a few bugs.
